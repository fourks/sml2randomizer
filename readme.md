## What Do You Need

* The randomizer (download link above)
* Java (JRE) 8 (get it [here](https://www.java.com/download/))
* A  ROM of Super Mario Land 2 (v1.0 and v1.2 both allowed)
* A way to play (emulator (like bgb or gambatte) or Game Boy EverDrive)

## What To Do

Plug in your ROM of SML2, either select your options or input a custom seed, and press `Randomize ROM`. If successful, the result is saved in the same location as the selected ROM.

## What Does It Do

You can randomize the following:

* All non-boss level locations on the overworld
* Normal and secret exits of levels with two exits
* Most enemies within each level
* All power-ups in each level
* Platforms in a few levels
* Some additional aspects, such as music and physics

If you race the randomizer, it gives you a `.setgoal` line to paste into the SRL channel, which updates the goal automatically, as well as shares the seed with all racers.

## Research

All research that has been compiled during the creation of this randomizer is available [here](https://github.com/slashinfty/sml2randomizer/blob/master/research/research.md).

## Special Thanks

* veearr - without you the programming of this would have taken me all Summer, rather than just Spring break
* Raccoon Sam, smellymoo - almost all of the ROM data came from existing knowledge found by the two of you, and I am eternally thankful for that
* dotsarecool, authorblues - the two of you were my inspiration and my first seeds of knowledge
* oh_deer, typwo, beastfrisian, wolfrune - the SML2 community has been nothing short of wonderful in helping me test this and further refine it
