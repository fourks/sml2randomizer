## What Do You Need

* The randomizer
* A ROM of Super Mario Land 2
* A way to play (emulator or EverDrive)

## What To Do

Plug in your ROM of SML2, either select your options or input a custom seed, and press `Randomize ROM`. If successful, the result is saved in the same location as the selected ROM.

## What Does It Do

You can randomize the following:

* All non-boss level locations on the overworld
* Normal and secret exits of levels with two exits
* Most enemies within each level
* All power-ups in each level
* Platforms in a few levels
* Some additional aspects, such as music and physics

If you race the randomizer, it gives you a `.setgoal` line to paste into the SRL channel, which updates the goal automatically, as well as shares the seed with all racers.

## Research

Will be coming soon (TM).
