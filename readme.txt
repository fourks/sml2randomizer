A randomizer for Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins.

Originally written in Java and released in 2017. Rewritten in JavaScript in 2018.

Licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0.

Randomizes levels on the overworld, exits in levels with two exits, bosses in boss levels, boss health, most enemies within each level, all power-ups in each level, platforms in a few levels, and a few additional aspects, including music, physics, and scrolling.

In order to play, you need a ROM of SML2 (either v1.0 or v1.2) and a way to play (emulator or EverDrive).

All research that was done in creating this randomizer has been saved and can be found in the research folder.
